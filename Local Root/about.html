a short
and beautiful ferry ride from Horseshoe Bay,
which is 30 min past West Vancouver. It is
ideally located for touring the B.C. mainland
and Vancouver Island, in your motorhome.

Transfers to and from our property are
included in our prices. (Does not apply to short
term rentals under 10 days). We will arrange
for a taxi to meet you at the Airport or at a
Vancouver hotel, and bring you to the ferry
terminal in Horseshoe Bay (just past West
Vancouver). After a short ferry ride, which is
already the beginning of a great holiday and a
great ride through paradise, we will meet you and bring you to your motorhome. After
you have returned the vehicle to us, we will arrange for a taxi to take you back to
Vancouver.
</p>
<p>
Our motorhomes are all kept in very good interior, exterior and mechanical condition.
We take a real pride in the way we look after you during your vacation. Your transfer
from the airport or your hotel will be arranged with your booking. When you arrive at
our property, your motorhome will be waiting for you and will be travel-ready.
</p>
<p>
This means beds made, kitchen equipped and cupboards clean for your personal
items. Your motorhome will have full gasoline and propane tanks. You will also find
many extras to make your trip more enjoyable (at no extra cost).
