<h1>FAQs</h1>
<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Do I need a special driver's license?</h3>
You do not need an International driver&#8217;s license for your motorhome trip in
BC and USA. All you need is your regular valid drivers license. Only persons
named on the contract are permitted to drive the rented vehicle. More than
one person can be registered as driver without any additional fee.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Where is your pick up and drop off location?</h3>
Happy Holidays Motorhome Rentals is located in Gibsons on the Sunshine
Coast. We are not far away from Vancouver. The road to the Sunshine
Coast (a scenic 30 minute drive away from Vancouver city centre to
Horseshoe Bay to Langdale/Gibsons plus a 40 minute ferry ride) is already
the beginning of a great holiday and a great ride through paradise.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Can we pick up in Vancouver and drop off in Calgary or vice versa?</h3>

Sorry, we offer round trips only with pick up and drop off in Gibsons (north of
Vancouver). We pick you up at the Vancouver Airport or at a hotel in
Vancouver and bring you to the ferry terminal in Horseshoe Bay. After a very
beautiful 40 minute ferry ride, we will meet you and bring you to your
motorhome.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Are transfers included in the rental?</h3>
Transfers to and from our property are included in our prices. (Sorry, not
available for rentals less than 10 days.) We will arrange for a taxi to meet
you at the airport or a Vancouver hotel, and bring you to the ferry terminal in
Horseshoe Bay (just past West Vancouver). After a ferry ride, we will meet
you and bring you to your motorhome. After you have returned the vehicle to
us, we will arrange for a taxi to take you back to Vancouver. The ferry
crossing over here at pick up will be reimbursed to you, the ferry going back
to the Mainland is free, however, the ferry when bringing the MH back to us
is at your expense.
</li>
<li>
<h3>You mention a ferry crossing to your pick up point,
how long does this take?</h3>
The taxi drive from the Airport to the ferry terminal is about 45-60 minutes,
depending on the traffic. Relax before you pick up your motorhome. The
ferry trip is 40 minutes, we are very close to the ferry here on the Sunshine
Coast. 1000&#8217;s of guests are enjoying this ride through our paradise.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Do we need to bring camping equipment?</h3>
No, included in our rates are &#8220;kits&#8221; that includes linens, cooking wares,
utensils, etc. to make you comfortable on the road. You should bring your
flash light though! In addition, the motorhome rental includes camping chairs,
woodsmans&#8217; axe, bucket, water hose, some tools. When you arrive to pick up
your motorhome, it will be ready for you and will be travel ready. This means,
beds are made, the kitchen equipped with all the necessary dishes, pots and
pan, cutlery, etc. You will find matches, first aid kit, sewing kit and then there
of course towels supplied to you. Your motorhome will have full gasoline and
propane tank, the water tank is also filled.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Is it possible to purchase more than 1 mileage package
in the hire?</h3>
You can purchase more than 1 mileage package before the start of your trip
but we recommend not to drive more than 300 km per day. Your motorhome
trip is supposed to be a vacation and not a highway chase, right?
</li>
<li>
<h3>What type of gas mileage can I expect with my rental vehicle?</h3>

As numerous conditions affect gas mileage (wind, hills, speed, driving habits,
etc.), fuel consumption will vary according to the conditions. As a rough "rule
of thumb", you could budget about 25 liters/100 kilometers.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Is there any refund if part of a mileage package is not used?</h3>
100 km per day are included in the rental price. Extra kilometers are
calculated at 29 cents per kilometer upon return of the motorhome. If you
know that you will need more km, we have two additional packages available
(500 km for $135, 1000 km for $260). Additional km packages can be
purchased at the time of the booking and/or at the time of the pick up. We do
not offer unlimited mileage packages and Please note that there is no refund
for unused kilometers.
</li>

<h3>If I wish to fit a certified forward facing child seat in a motorhome&#8230;</h3>

If I wish to fit a certified forward facing child seat in a motorhome, what seats
have the appropriate tether anchor points? and which vehicles are these in?
The seats will have to be placed on the bench (at the dining table) in the 22&#8242;,
24&#8242;, 26&#8242; and 31&#8242; motorhomes.

Please let us know if
you bring your own or if you would like to rent a baby/booster seat.
